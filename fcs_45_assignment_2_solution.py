# Question 3
############

#what we can do here is cast the string into a list and then use the .sort() function on the lists, then we can easily compare the sorted lists to see if they are equal or not
#if they are not equal the function will return False, otherwise True

# Question 4

#Max

    if l[x] > highest:
      highest = l[x] #when we find a value higher than what we had stored, we repalce it with the new highest value

  return highest

# Question 5

  return s[0] + removeConsecutiveDuplicates(s[1:]) #also shortening string but also concatenating outside, so when the base case is reached it will keep returning and concatenating the string without the repeating consecutive characters
